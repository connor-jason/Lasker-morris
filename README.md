## Visualization of three misclassified images
The misclassified images are included here. The three images are all labeled angry, but misclassified as happy or neutral. 
My observation is that the misclassifications as happy happened because their mouths were wide and upturned,
and the misclassification as neutral is on an image that is very subtle and not overtly angry (mouth is not downturned, just neutral).
